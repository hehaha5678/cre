/**
 * A month-of-year, such as 'July'.
 * <p>
 * {@code Month} is an enum representing the 12 months of the year -
 * January, February, March, April, May, June, July, August, September, October,
 * November and December.
 * <p>
 * In addition to the textual enum name, each month-of-year has an {@code int} value.
 * The {@code int} value follows normal usage and the ISO-8601 standard,
 * from 1 (January) to 12 (December). It is recommended that applications use the enum
 * rather than the {@code int} value to ensure code clarity.
 * <p>
 * <b>Do not use {@code ordinal()} to obtain the numeric representation of {@code Month}.
 * Use {@code handlerCloumnValue()} instead.</b>
 * <p>
 * This enum represents a common concept that is found in many calendar systems.
 * As such, this enum may be used by any calendar system that has the month-of-year
 * concept defined exactly equivalent to the ISO-8601 calendar system.
 *
 * @implSpec This is an immutable and thread-safe enum.
